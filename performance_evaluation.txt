Two implementations were tested. The first creates a fixed number of workers depending on what branch that request a 
thread for a parition to sort. The later limits the number of threads for each depth in the recursion resulting in that the number of worker threads are
of the power of two.

FIXED NUMBER OF WORKER THREADS

HARDWARE = Intel Core i7-2600 3,40 GHz ( 8 HW THREADS )
OS = UBUNTU 64

Sorting 100 000 000 integers

Number of Threads ( including main thread ):
1 : 11.4829 s
2 : 10.8041 s
3 : 10.8041 s
4 : 5.25204 s
5 : 5.08232 s
6 : 5.11402 s
7 : 5.11423 s
8 : 5.12826 s
10 : 5.17909 s
20 : 5.12016 s
40 : 5.13015 s
80 : 5.25452 s
100 : 5.12902 s

Disscusion:
It seems like 5 threads is the optimal for sorting however in theory 8 threads should be optimal
if all hw threads are available to the operating system. 
It seems like it doesn't scheduale the work on all cores.
It also likely that the implementation doesn't balance tree properly according to the number of threads.
At the moment there are a limited number of threads and the main thread will start executing the left tree however as 
thread creation takes time the left tree will have more threads compared to the right. This could be fixed by limiting the threads
to a depth or having a pool of threads where each branch waits for a thread to finish.


WORKER THREADS LIMITED BY DEPTH

HARDWARE = Intel Core i7-2600 3,40 GHz ( 8 HW THREADS )
OS = UBUNTU 64

Sorting 100 000 000 integers

Number of Threads ( including main thread ):

1 : 11.625 s
2 : 10.2993 s
4 : 5.08549 s
8 : 4.05889 s
16 : 3.01693 s
32 : 2.62423 s
63 : 2.54307 s

Disscusion:
It shows clearly by limiting the number of worker threads for each level in the recursion balance 
the workload as each thread will sort the equal amount of data in the array. It's intressting to note that more threads 
descrease the calculation time which means that the first implementation does indeed not sheadule the work for all cores while the seconds does.
The optimal number of threads should be 8 if they are all running on a separate core.
