HARDWARE = Intel Core i7-2600 3,40 GHz ( 8 HW THREADS )
OS = UBUNTU 64

1 : sorting 100 000 000 integers

Number of Threads ( including main thread ):
1 : 11.4829 s
2 : 10.8041 s
3 : 10.8041 s
4 : 5.25204 s
5 : 5.08232 s
6 : 5.11402 s
7 : 5.11423 s
8 : 5.12826 s
10 : 5.17909 s
20 : 5.12016 s
40 : 5.13015 s
80 : 5.25452 s
100 : 5.12902 s

Disscusion:
It seems like 5 threads is the optimal for sorting however in theory 8 threads should be optimal
if all hw threads are available to the operating system. 
It seems like it doesn't scheduale the work on all cores.
It also likely that the implementation doesn't balance tree properly according to the number of threads.
At the moment there are a limited number of threads and the main thread will start executing the left tree however as 
thread creation takes time the left tree will have more threads compared to the right. This could be fixed by limiting the threads
to a depth or having a pool of threads where each branch waits for a thread to finish.
